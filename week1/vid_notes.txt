ML Definition #2, Tom Mitchell (1998) - Well Posted Learning Problem
A computer program is said to "learn" from experience E w.r.t. some task T and
some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

Some types of learning algos:
1. Supervised learning:

	Some "right answers" are given, task of the algo is to predict more right answers.
						 
	Regression problem - continuous values for output
						 
	Classification problem - discrete values/classifications for output. You could have 
	infinite classifications of something, but there are mathetmatical ways to store 
	infinite classifications.

2. Unsupervised learning:

	"Here is a dataset, can you find any structure in this dataset?"

	Clustering technique.
	E.g. - computing equipment clusters, social network anaylsis, market segmentation,
	astronomical data analysis.
