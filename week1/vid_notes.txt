ML Definition #2, Tom Mitchell (1998) - Well Posted Learning Problem
A computer program is said to "learn" from experience E w.r.t. some task T and
some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

Some types of learning algos:
1. Supervised learning - Some "right answers" are given, task of the algo is to
						 predict more right answers.
						 
						 Regression problem - continuous values for output
						 
						 Classification problem - discrete values/classifications 
						 for output. You could have infinite classifications of 
						 something, but there are mathetmatical ways to store 
						 infinite classifications.
