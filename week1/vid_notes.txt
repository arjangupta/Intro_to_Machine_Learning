ML Definition #2, Tom Mitchell (1998) - Well Posted Learning Problem
A computer program is said to "learn" from experience E w.r.t. some task T and
some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

Some types of learning algos:
1. Supervised learning:

	Some "right answers" are given, task of the algo is to predict more right answers.
						 
	Regression problem - continuous values for output
						 
	Classification problem - discrete values/classifications for output. You could have 
	infinite classifications of something, but there are mathetmatical ways to store 
	infinite classifications.

2. Unsupervised learning:

	"Here is a dataset, can you find any structure in this dataset?"

	Clustering technique.
	E.g. - computing equipment clusters, social network anaylsis, market segmentation,
	astronomical data analysis.


	Cocktail party problem
	2 microphones, record a different combination of two people talking - couting in
	English and Spanish, from two microphones at different locations in the room. Give
	this data to an unsupervised ML algo, you will see that it is able to extract those
	two voices. Similar situation when it is a human voice against music.

	Cocktail party algo code:
	[W, s, v] = svd( ( repmat( sum(x.*x, 1), size(x,1), 1 ) .* x ) *x' );
