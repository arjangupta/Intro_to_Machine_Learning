# Week 2

The hello.mat was created by executing `save hello.mat a`. We had already declared `a = 3`.

You can check the current variables in scope using `who`. `whos` gives a more detailed view.

Execute `clear` to clear all vars, and `clear a` will clear specifically a.

Execute `load hello.mat` to load the contents of that .mat file into your current session.

You can also save to a human readable format by executing `save hello.txt a -ascii`.
